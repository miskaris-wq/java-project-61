# java-project-61: Hexlet Project - Brain Games

## Description

This repository contains a Java project completed as part of the Hexlet training program. It is a collection of console-based "Brain Games" designed to train logic and basic mathematical skills.

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to provide a set of simple yet engaging console games that demonstrate Java programming skills, including:

*   Working with console input and output.
*   Generating random numbers and performing mathematical operations.
*   Implementing game logic.
*   Structuring code and reusing components.

## Functionality

The project includes the following "Brain Games":

*   Even Game: The game presents a random number and asks if it is even.
*   Calc Game: The game presents an arithmetic expression that needs to be calculated.
*   GCD Game (Greatest Common Divisor):** The game presents two numbers, and you need to find their greatest common divisor (GCD).
*   Progression Game: The game presents an arithmetic progression with one number missing, and you need to determine the missing number.
*   Prime Game: The game presents a random number and asks if it is prime.

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/miskaris-wq/java-project-61.git
    cd java-project-61
    ```

2.  Build the project (using Make):

    ```
    make build
    ```

3.  Run the project (via Make):

    ```
    make run
    ```

    This command will launch the main program, which will prompt you to select one of the available games.
    Then, follow the instructions in the console to choose a game and answer the questions.

## Requirements

*   Java 11 or higher.
*   Make installed (for building and running with `make build` and `make run` commands).

## Dependencies

The project has no external dependencies other than the standard Java library.
